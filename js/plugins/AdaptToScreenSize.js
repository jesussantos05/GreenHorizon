/*: 

 * @plugindesc This plugin automatically changes the resolution of the game to the screen size of the device used. 

 * @author KYDSGAME

 * 

 * @help 

 * To use this plugin, just place it in the js/plugins folder and enable it in the Plugin Manager. 

 * This plugin will detect the screen size of the device used and adjust the game resolution accordingly. 

 * This plugin will also resize the game window to fit the screen size if the game is played on a browser. 

 * This plugin will work with any resolution, but it is recommended to use a 16:9 aspect ratio for the best results. 

 * This plugin will also scale the graphics and fonts to match the resolution, so you don't need to worry about them being too small or too big. 

 * This plugin will not affect the save files, so you can switch devices without any problems. 

 * This plugin will also work with other plugins that change the resolution, such as MUSH: Screen Resolution Menu Option[^1^][2]. 

 * However, if you use multiple plugins that change the resolution, make sure to place this plugin below them in the Plugin Manager.
